Download the data from the kaggle website and place the dataset folder in the root directory of the repository. In the Data preprocessing notebook, update the IMAGE_PATH with the path corresponding to where you placed the dataset. Assuming the downloaded folder was just called `dataset` and it was placed in the root diretory, no changes to the python notebook are needed.
